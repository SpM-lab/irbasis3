sparse-ir - A library for the intermediate representation of propagators
========================================================================
This library provides routines for constructing and working with the
intermediate representation of correlation functions.  It provides:

 - on-the-fly computation of basis functions for arbitrary cutoff Î›
 - basis functions and singular values are accurate to full precision
 - routines for sparse sampling


Installation
------------
Install via `pip <https://pypi.org/project/sparse-ir>`_::

    pip install sparse-ir[xprec]

The above line is the recommended way to install `sparse-ir`.  It automatically
installs the `xprec <https://github.com/tuwien-cms/xprec>`_ package, which
allows one to compute the IR basis functions with greater accuracy.  If you do
not want to do this, simply remove the string ``[xprec]`` from the above command.

Install via `conda <https://anaconda.org/spm-lab/sparse-ir>`_::

    conda install -c spm-lab sparse-ir xprec

Other than the optional xprec dependency, sparse-ir requires only
`numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and `scipy <https://scipy.org/>`_.


Quick start
-----------
Check out our comprehensive `tutorial <https://spm-lab.github.io/sparse-ir-tutorial>`_!

Here is a full second-order perturbation theory solver (GF(2)) in a few
lines of Python code::

    # Construct the IR basis and sparse sampling for fermionic propagators
    import sparse_ir, numpy as np
    basis = sparse_ir.FiniteTempBasis('F', beta=10, wmax=8, eps=1e-6)
    stau = ir.TauSampling(basis)
    siw = ir.MatsubaraSampling(basis, positive_only=True)

    # Solve the single impurity Anderson model coupled to a bath with a
    # semicircular states with unit half bandwidth.
    U = 1.2
    def rho0w(w):
        return np.sqrt(1-w.clip(-1,1)**2) * 2/np.pi

    # Compute the IR basis coefficients for the non-interacting propagator
    rho0l = basis.v.overlap(rho0w)
    G0l = -basis.s * rho0l

    # Self-consistency loop: alternate between second-order expression for the
    # self-energy and the Dyson equation until convergence.
    Gl = G0l
    Gl_prev = 0
    while np.linalg.norm(Gl - Gl_prev) > 1e-6:
        Gl_prev = Gl
        Gtau = stau.evaluate(Gl)
        Sigmatau = U**2 * Gtau**3
        Sigmal = stau.fit(Sigmatau)
        Sigmaiw = siw.evaluate(Sigmal)
        G0iw = siw.evaluate(G0l)
        Giw = 1/(1/G0iw - Sigmaiw)
        Gl = siw.fit(Giw)

You may want to start with reading up on the `intermediate representation`_.
It is tied to the analytic continuation of bosonic/fermionic spectral
functions from (real) frequencies to imaginary time, a transformation mediated
by a kernel ``K``.  The kernel depends on a cutoff, which you should choose to
be ``lambda_ >= beta * W``, where ``beta`` is the inverse temperature and ``W``
is the bandwidth.

One can now perform a `singular value expansion`_ on this kernel, which
generates two sets of orthonormal basis functions, one set ``v[l](w)`` for
real frequency side ``w``, and one set ``u[l](tau)`` for the same obejct in
imaginary (Euclidean) time ``tau``, together with a "coupling" strength
``s[l]`` between the two sides.

By this construction, the imaginary time basis can be shown to be *optimal* in
terms of compactness.
